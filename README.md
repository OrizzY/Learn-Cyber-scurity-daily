# Learn-Cyber-Security-Daily
Welcome! 😁

> *This is a documentation of my learning journey in Cybersecurity — daily notes, exercise outputs, and reflections. All exercises were done in the Termux environment and are simulated because my laptop can't run virtual machines and I'm not comfortable dual-booting yet, so I use Termux on my phone.*

---

## 📌 Summary

I document my daily learning progress. Goal: create neat notes on GitHub that also serve as a personal reference.

## 📅 Progress Log

### 🧩 Day 1 — Basic Linux Commands & File Manipulation

**Focus:** navigation, file operations, redirection, simple loops.

**Commands learned:**

```bash
pwd, cd, mkdir, mv, cp, cat, echo, for loop, >, >>, 2>
```

**Example result / snippet:**

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do echo "file $i" > file$i.txt; done
```

**Short note:** shell basics are the foundation of pentesting. Start here so you won't complain later when dealing with tools.

---

### ⚙️ Day 2 — Process Management & Command Chaining

**Focus:** view processes, command chaining, text parsing with awk/grep.

**Commands learned:**

```bash
ps aux, head, grep, awk, printf, alias, redirection
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat sim_hosts.txt | grep "up" | awk '{print $1}'
```

**Short note:** the pipe (`|`) is a weapon. Combine small tools into powerful workflows.

---

### 🔍 Day 3 — Text Filtering & Data Extraction

**Focus:** grep, sed, awk, cut, sort, uniq — parsing simulated scan output.

**Commands learned:**

```bash
grep, sed, awk, cut, sort, uniq
```

**Example:**

```bash
grep "open" fake_scan.txt | awk '{print $1,$3}'
```

**Short note:** parsing logs/output is key to producing fast, useful reports.

## 🧾 Example Files / Evidence

I included exercise files in the `labs` folder that contain terminal outputs for each day. These files can be used as proof of activity.

---

## 🎯 Next Goals

* Install & try `nmap` in a real environment  
* Learn `netcat`, `curl`, `wget` for recon  
* Start writing simple `bash` scripts for parsing automation  
* Simulate a basic WordPress security audit (fake target)

---

## 🧰 Environment

* Platform: Termux (Android)  
* Shell: Bash  
* Tools used so far: `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`

## 🚨 Disclaimer

All activities are simulations in a personal environment. *No testing has been performed on real systems without permission.*
